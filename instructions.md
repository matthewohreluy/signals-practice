## Instructions

### 1. Refactor to Signals
- Convert the existing application state management to use **Angular Signals**.
- Replace any `@Input()` and `@Output()` with `input()` and `output()`.
- Use `signal()` to hold the cart items.
- Use `computed()` if necessary to derive values (e.g., total price, item count).
- Use `effect()` if you need to react to state changes.

### 3. Remove from Cart (Toggle Behavior)
- If the user clicks again on a product that is already in the cart:
  - Remove the item from the cart.
  - Reset the product card background color to its default.
